## Overview of the Analysis

The CEO of a ride sharing company has requested an analysis to understand market trends by market area type (Urban, Suburban, Rural). In addition, the CEO would like to understand how total fares have trended over time on a weekly basis. For this analysis, we have produced two deliverables
* A ride-sharing summary by city type that contains ride, driver, and fare data;
* A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

In the sections below, we'll review the results, insights, and recommendations.

## Results
For our first deliverable, we have developed a summary table that shows total rides, total drivers, total fare value, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.

### Insight 1: Urban environments generate the highest fare volume
* Rural environments have the fewest number of rides (125), but these rides gross the highest fares on average ($34).
* Suburban environments generate 5x more rides than Rural environments and nearly gross almost $31 per ride. 
* Urban environments generate almost 2.5x more rides than Suburban environments. Although Urban rides tend to generate lower fares per ride ($24.5), the total fares are 2x greater and 9x greater than suburban and rural markets respectively.

### Insight 2: Total Rides to Total Driver ratios differ substantially across market types
* the rides to driver ratios in rural (125/78 = 1.6) and suburban environments (625/490 = 1.3) exceed 1, which suggests these markets are underserved.
* The number of rides to drivers in urban environments (1625/2405 = 0.7) is below 1, which may lead to driver dissatisfaction and contributes to the low fare amounts per driver ($16.57).

For our second deliverable, we analyzed the total fare value by city type (January '19 - April '19). The chart plots the total fare amount by week in rural, suburban, and urban environments.

### Insight 3: Urban & Suburban markets are growing, while Rural markets are stagnant
* Urban & Suburban market environments experienced growth in total fare volume over time as the total fares at the end of the period are several hundred dollars higher than at the beginning of the period.
* Rural market environments show no increase in total fare volume.
* The fourth week of February showed the largest total fare volume across all market environments.

## Summary
Based on the three insights in the results section, we have developed 3 recommendations for PyBer.
1. Invest in efforts to increase total ride volume in urban environments. These high volume markets are growing and represent the majority of the fare volume. Moreover, there is insufficient ride volume to support the number of drivers in these markets.
2. Optimize driver incentives so that markets are adequately served. 
3. Pivot to growing market environments: shift investment from rural markets to suburban and urban markets.
